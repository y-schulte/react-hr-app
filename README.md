My final project of the SPA module after 1,5 months' introduction to React:
Make sure to install the react router to see it: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom

**Concept**  
HR App that allows to create the applicants, check and filter their data, as well as to reject them.
The project is published in Githubpages: [Link](https://y-schulte.github.io/react-hr-app)

**Features used**
Dynamic Rooter, useEffect with multiple declarations, Hooks, localStorage to store data locally in the browser

**Note for testing purposes**
